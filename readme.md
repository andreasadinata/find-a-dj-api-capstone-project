##Introduction
Find DJ's will show the user the top DJs which has been performed well for the past a week. The update will be based on the EDM Magazine and
many other EDM websites. The user will be shown around 5-10 DJs and user can choose on each selections to get to the list of 30s of their songs, In case the user
does not really know the name.

##Use Case
Why is this app useful? As a Musician especially in this case producer or DJ, the Idea of the songs which can be played is very crucial.
Musician believe that listening to many songs can help them to improve their music's knowledge. The app will help them to listen to new songs every single weeks.
The easy features will not only help the DJs and Producers. People who just want to listen to a short preview song can also listen to the updates, and enjoy the good 30s musics.
Moreover, the website can also help the rising stars producers to be recognised and appreciated by the community, since the selections of the producer will have no boundaries.

##Live Site

##Technical
* The app is built by HTML5, JS, CSS, and JQUery.
* Spotify's API is the main source of the preview songs.
* The app is responsive where it can be easily accessed by mobile phone, tablet, and computer.
* The database of the songs will be based on the spotify available songs at current region.

##Road Map
The app will have an automatic update on the database, instead of depending on the developer to update the DJs list manually.
Furthermore, in the future, the app will not only depending on the 1 API's only as their main source. There are plenty music streaming APIs
in the current market, and hopefully we can add more variaties in the app.
